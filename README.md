Abstract 
 “E-Sawasthya” is a system designed to store the medical records of patients visiting government hospitals in a centralized database. Patients visiting from one hospital to another have to carry OPD cards, prescription and other medical records while visiting from one hospital to another. Our system intends to solve this issue by creating a centralized record of the patients of government hospitals and making it accessible to other government hospitals. The hospital can review the records and add new diagnosis, prescription and other patient details. This means that when a patient visits another government hospital, their medical history will be already available. With a user-friendly design, our system will save time, reduce cost and improve healthcare services by making sure that hospitals have necessary information to provide better treatment.
